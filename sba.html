                    <h2>(2023-2024) Nominated For Human Spirit Award </h2>
                    <p>I am thrilled to share that I have recently been honored with the prestigious Human Spirit Award
                        for my
                        brand, ShotbyALL. This recognition represents a significant milestone in my journey as an
                        entrepreneur
                        and photographer, highlighting my dedication to making a positive impact through my work. I was
                        nominated for this award through ECornell (Entrepreneurship at Cornell University.) I am deeply
                        honored
                        to have been nominated for this remarkable $5,000 opportunity to nurture and expand my brand.
                    </p>
                    <p>*My photography style is deeply rooted in portraits and people-centric
                        photography, characterized by the innovative use of fisheye lenses and wide angles to offer
                        dynamic and
                        unique perspectives. </p>
                    <p> *My work extends beyond the traditional boundaries of photography, seeking to engage viewers in
                        a visual
                        dialogue through every picture. I aspire to provide a platform for minority and underrepresented
                        individuals, offering them the opportunity to see themselves in a positive light and fostering a
                        sense
                        of confidence that extends beyond the frame. </p>
                    <i>This is not only about photography, this is about my entrepreneurship skills of building a
                        trademark and
                        giving back to my community through creativity.</i>
