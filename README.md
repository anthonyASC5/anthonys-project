To access the main homepage, open the index.html file. The index.html file is the homepage consisting of content about me, images, a nav bar with other pages, and a link to email me.
The projects tab (projects.html) is the page consisting of websites I have made in the past. Jobs365 being my favorite project so far. Click the "Lall" icon in the top left corner to go back to the homepage. 
The visions tab (visions.html) is the page consisting of pictures I have taken at Cornell University. This page is basically a portfolio of my work in photography and editing. Click the "Lall" icon in the top left corner to go back to the homepage. 
The "Draw" tab is a widget that I made in javascript in which you can draw in. There is a button to change the color of the brush and a slider to change the size of the brush.

Everything is coded from scratch, I used prior knowledge and projects to build this website. Everything is original. 

Anthony Lall Lewis.
