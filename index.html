            Programs like All Star Code, NYU STEP, ACE, and Global Kids provided me with valuable exploration and
            mentorship.
            Personally, I am proud of the opportunity to mentor male students from underrepresented communities this
            summer.
            I realized my influence when instilling to my students that the color of their skin should not limit their
            success. I want to
            improve our communities
            by advocating for mentoring of people of color to build empowered youth who can in turn influence the even
            younger generation in their communities in education,
            technology, college access, career, etc.Â

            Jobs365 is a project I worked on at All Star Code during my Summer intensive. Jobs365 is a resource for
            teens under 18 in need of employment - a common issue that I had faced.
            Jobs365 gives access to all types of jobs nearby the user, from companies and organizations to odd jobs and
            tutoring, so
            they always have an opportunity to work simply be a source of a job when needed.
            I want to continue learning and working to refine this project, including connecting with my community on
            posting job openings. Revenue and business will come from
            local companies who want their jobs posted and advertised on the website. Jobs365 website was made with
            Javascript, HTML + CSS.

            <p class="atitle"> Life </p>
            Grown up in Brooklyn, New York - now majoring in Computer Science at The Cornell University School of
            Engineering. My aspiration is to become a leader in technology development influencing the biases and
            inequities in technology.
            I want to advance equity and inclusiveness in the technology development behind social media, journalism,
            criminal justice/
            facial recognition, and other programs that we use in our everyday lives.
