            <p>Improving communication between college students in long-distance relationships by allowing for stronger
                passive conveyance of emotions and providing a creative bonding outlet</p>
            <h1>Design Problem </h1>
            <p>College students in long-distance relationships struggle to communicate adequately with their partners
                due to their busy schedules. Text, as their main mode of communication, is ineffective at conveying
                intangibles like emotions and tone of voice, leading to misunderstandings that make navigating
                long-distance relationships even more difficult.</p>
            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <p>
                LDR Couples primarily communicate and connect at night
                Most LDR couples engage in some virtual activity to maintain the ‘spark’ in their relationship
                Misunderstandings and miscommunications often arise in LDRs due to text being the primary mode of
                communication and interaction. It's difficult to convey emotional nuances through text alone, especially
                if couples don’t speak frequently throughout the day.
                Some partners enjoy the independence and space that come with an LDR, while others may struggle with
                feelings of clinginess. Expressing these differences can pose challenges for couples who haven’t
                communicated them.

            <h2>(2023-2024) Nominated For Human Spirit Award </h2>
            <p>I am thrilled to share that I have recently been honored with the prestigious Human Spirit Award for my
                brand, ShotbyALL. This recognition represents a significant milestone in my journey as an entrepreneur
                and photographer, highlighting my dedication to making a positive impact through my work. I was
                nominated for this award through ECornell (Entrepreneurship at Cornell University.) I am deeply honored
                to have been nominated for this remarkable $5,000 opportunity to nurture and expand my brand.</p>
            <p>*The core philosophy of ShotbyALL revolves around the belief that every individual has the potential for
                transformation and empowerment, and I am dedicated to capturing and showcasing this transformative
                quality in every image. My photography style is deeply rooted in portraits and people-centric
                photography, characterized by the innovative use of fisheye lenses and wide angles to offer dynamic and
                unique perspectives. Each photograph I create is a narrative, designed to connect with and celebrate the
                diverse experiences of my subjects.</p>
            <p> *My work extends beyond the traditional boundaries of photography, seeking to engage viewers in a visual
                dialogue through every picture. At the heart of ShotbyALL lies an unwavering commitment to diversity,
                inclusion, and empowerment. I aspire to provide a platform for minority and underrepresented
                individuals, offering them the opportunity to see themselves in a positive light and fostering a sense
                of confidence that extends beyond the frame. </p>
            <i>This is not only about photography, this is about my entrepreneurship skills of building a trademark and
                giving back to my community through creativity.</i>

                    <p>Programs like All Star Code, NYU STEP, ACE, and Global Kids provided me with valuable exploration and mentorship. Personally, I am proud of the opportunity to mentor male students from underrepresented communities this summer. I realized my influence when instilling in my students that the color of their skin should not limit their success. I want to improve our communities by advocating for mentoring of people of color to build empowered youth who can, in turn, influence the even younger generation in their communities in education, technology, college access, career, etc.</p>

                    <p>Jobs365 is a project I worked on at All Star Code during my Summer intensive. Jobs365 is a resource for teens under 18 in need of employment - a common issue that I had faced. Jobs365 gives access to all types of jobs nearby the user, from companies and organizations to odd jobs and tutoring, so they always have an opportunity to work simply be a source of a job when needed. I want to continue learning and working to refine this project, including connecting with my community on posting job openings. Revenue and business will come from local companies who want their jobs posted and advertised on the website. Jobs365 website was made with Javascript, HTML + CSS. Click to visit Jobs365!</p>
