            passive conveyance of emotions and providing a creative bonding outlet
            <br></h1>
           <h2> Design Problem:
            College students in long-distance relationships struggle to communicate adequately with their partners due
            to their busy schedules. Text, as their main mode of communication, is ineffective at conveying intangibles
            like emotions and tone of voice, leading to misunderstandings that make navigating long-distance
            relationships even more difficult.
            <br>
            <br>
            User Research:
            LDR Couples primarily communicate and connect at night Most LDR couples engage in some virtual activity to
            maintain the ‘spark’ in their relationship Misunderstandings and miscommunications often arise in LDRs due
            to text being the primary mode of communication and interaction. It's difficult to convey emotional nuances
            through text alone,
            especially if couples don’t speak frequently throughout the day.

            <h2>(2023-2024) Nominated For Human Spirit Award </h2>
            <p>I am thrilled to share that I have recently been honored with the prestigious Human Spirit Award for my
                brand, ShotbyALL. This recognition represents a significant milestone in my journey as an entrepreneur
                and photographer, highlighting my dedication to making a positive impact through my work. I was
                nominated for this award through ECornell (Entrepreneurship at Cornell University.) I am deeply honored
                to have been nominated for this remarkable $5,000 opportunity to nurture and expand my brand.</p>
            <p>*My photography style is deeply rooted in portraits and people-centric
                photography, characterized by the innovative use of fisheye lenses and wide angles to offer dynamic and
                unique perspectives. </p>
            <p> *My work extends beyond the traditional boundaries of photography, seeking to engage viewers in a visual
                dialogue through every picture. I aspire to provide a platform for minority and underrepresented
                individuals, offering them the opportunity to see themselves in a positive light and fostering a sense
                of confidence that extends beyond the frame. </p>
            <i>This is not only about photography, this is about my entrepreneurship skills of building a trademark and
                giving back to my community through creativity.</i>

                    <h2>JOBS365</h2>
                    <p>Jobs365 is a project I worked on at All Star Code during my Summer intensive. Jobs365 is a
                        resource for teens under 18 in need of employment - a common issue that I had faced. Jobs365
                        gives access to all types of jobs nearby the user, from companies and organizations to odd jobs
                        and tutoring, so they always have an opportunity to work simply be a source of a job when
                        needed. I want to continue learning and working to refine this project, including connecting
                        with my community on posting job openings. Revenue and business will come from local companies
                        who want their jobs posted and advertised on the website. Jobs365 website was made with
                        Javascript, HTML + CSS. Click to visit Jobs365!</p>

                        School of
                        Engineering. My aspiration is to become a leader in technology development influencing the
                        biases and
                        inequities in technology.
